# compressors_comparison

This app uses three packages to compress an image file: [flutter_image_compress](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_image_compress), [flutter_native_image](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_native_image), and [flutter_luban](https://github.com/crazecoder/flutter_luban). After comparing these packages, I can say `flutter_image_compress` is the best tool to compress images so far.
